# IOT-SMART-KITCHEN
the creation of an IoT-based smart kitchen system which implements two ESP32 microcontrollers. This system monitors temperature and gas status in real-time and then it applies automatic changes to the fan system, Peltier module and the servo-controlled valves. A Blynk dashboard then enables both user control.
